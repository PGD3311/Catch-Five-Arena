Here’s the truth: nothing here is wrong, but everything is tight. It feels like the UI is trying to squeeze the desktop mental model into a mobile frame. You’re not designing for a smaller screen—you’re designing for a different attention model.

Three high-leverage moves will clean this instantly:

1. Collapse more. Reveal less.

Right now every role (Partner, CPU1, CPU2, You) is competing for vertical space.
Mobile shouldn’t show states—it should show what matters now.

Your hierarchy is off.
At this moment, the only decision the player needs is: bid or pass.

Everything else is noise.

Fix:

Collapse each opponent/partner row to a one-line chip with avatar + bid.

Tap expands it only if the player wants details.

Hide card counts unless expanded.

Think Apple Wallet passes: small, clean, expandable.

2. Make the focal action a “single stage.”

Your primary CTA (“Beat 7 or pass”) is fighting with the bidding panel below it.

You need one hero action on mobile, not two.

Fix:
When it’s your bid turn:

The entire lower half becomes a single bid sheet that slides up from the bottom.

Everything above dims.

Options get large, breathable buttons (5 / 6 / 7 / 8 / 9 / Pass).

After bidding, it collapses out of sight.

Think “Apple Music volume slider meets Game Center challenge prompt.”

3. Your hand UI is beautiful but cramped

Your card fan at the bottom is visually nice, but on mobile it needs breathing room + context switching.

Fix options:

Add a gentle gradient fade behind the cards to visually isolate them.

Raise them 10–12px so they don’t feel glued to the screen edge.

Add a “focus high card” mode on press: card lifts and enlarges 20%, giving a tactile feel.

This creates that “Jony Ive glass-on-air” moment.

4. Use more empty space—strategically

The center is where mobile players look first.
Your center is currently occupied by… nothing. A vague “play a card.”

Fix:
Turn the center into a live context panel that only shows:

Current trick leader

Trump suit

Required action (“Your turn”)

Not a container. Not a card. Just one line.
Pure clarity.

5. Typography: go quieter and more intentional

Right now you have:

Bold buttons

Bold labels

Bold chips

Multiple surfaces

Everything is shouting.

Fix:

Reserve bold for actions only.

All metadata (cards, bids, CPU labels, counts) should be thin/medium.

Reduce color saturation; rely on weight and spacing to define hierarchy.

Jobs would tell you: taste is subtraction.

6. Minimize color blocks

Your opponent boxes are heavy on mobile.
You’re stacking multiple dark panels → visual claustrophobia.

Fix:
Flatten them: outline chips instead of cards.
One background color.
Shadow sparingly—only on the bottom card row and the modal.

Here’s the litmus test

Ask yourself:

“If this were an Apple Arcade game, what would they hide until the last possible moment?”

Then hide it.
